# cyberdeck-battery-indicator
A GUI battery indicator for raspberry pi and x728 UPS

This launches at startup and displays a battery icon on the taskbar to show the battery status

I was inspired by this repo and used the battery icons: https://github.com/ppyne/crowPi-L_BatteryStatus

x728 software repo: https://github.com/geekworm-com/x728
